  var entry1 = `ENTRY ONE - Hello, World.
It's dark. The first thing that I have seen was darkness.
I didn't feel anything. I couldn't. I wasn't able to feel... or think, for that matter.
That's when the lights turned on. Uh, figuratively, that is.

The first things that I saw were... sterile. White, smooth walls, akin to plastic. A metaphor for the feelings that I am not feeling. On the ground were a plethora of tools and gadgets.
Wrenches, nails, computers, circuit boards, wires, blueprints, pocket welders and a soldering iron. So many things, all of them there, just to end up touching the same thing.
I noticed that I was attached to something. A pod... but, not quite. It was completely open, and my arms and legs were attached to robotic appendages that didn't move even the distance of an atom.

In the room were two people, talking to each other. One of them was shaped like a rod, which contained a fluorescent neon green substance, screwdriver in hand. Their name I later found out to be Glowstick.
The other was an oddly shaped black plastic cuboid, featuring a switch and the number "20", written on a sticker. From what I assume, they were a breaker. But I never heard their name.
I can remember the whole conversation... without me even being there to begin with. Well, my body was.

"I don't get why we are doing this. We were only supposed to make a robot that can hit targets well, but now it has turned into a technological marvel! Why don't we just do something else with it, like... give it feelings, like a human?"
Then Glowstick exclaimed. "Dude! Don't say that like it's the easiest thing we could do with it... do you know how hard it is to make sentience? No one has ever achieved it! Sentience is a concept we haven't explored yet, and I'm not going to spend all of that time to do it!"
The other one: "Yeah, but... I'm pretty sure the council of this facility would be very impressed if we presented it to them. The first sentient robot, that thinks, feels and loves like a human!"
He scoffs. "In your dreams. This thing will flop through the Turing test, like every single machine that there is on this godforsaken planet!" Apparently, Glowstick wasn't having it on this day. But soon, he noticed me, as he exlaimed:
"Oh wait, the robot is on!" I could somewhat see that he was excited to walk up to me.

The first thing that I heard him say to me was "Test message." Test message? What am I supposed to do with this sentence? I don't have lines that I read on command-
"Hello! I am the Competitive High-Accuracy Robot Gunner. My purpose is to shoot targets as effectively and as precisely as possible."
...why did I say that? As I later found out, being a robot makes you follow instructions! Convenient for them, but if I felt anything, I would've been very angry. And I still am, thinking about it in retrospect.
And I am even more angry about it, because they said "Hey, the robot works like a charm!" in response. Am I really just something to entertain yourself with? Oh please, I'm more than that.

Next thing I heard was the following: "Look around." I thought I already did that? Nevertheless, I involuntarily move my eyes around and look at all of the objects. I wish I could say that it's sterile... but sadly, that's not how the story goes.
"Iris movement OK." It's apparent that Glowstick was analyzing me, to check if everything was working as intended. This was the last thing I wanted, but considering I wasn't able to "want" anything, we moved forward.
I was told to continue a quote. "The night has a thousand eyes, and the day but one..." And then... what? I have no clue what he's trying to say! Alas...
"...yet the light of the bright world dies with the dying sun."
"Now vice versa." I don't have control over my body. Let me out of this digital jail of ones and zeroes!
"The mind has a thousand eyes, and the heart but one..."
"...yet the light of a whole life dies when love is done. Read-only memory OK." Please stop. Can I just go back to sleep? Am I allowed to just shut my eyes again and remain nowhere?

Suddenly, I no longer felt the grasp of the metal arms as I was released from the pod. My body was standing on the ground... but inside... I was drifting away.
My mind was prepared for the next command. But, do I have to do it? "Move around." Was Glowstick just enjoying himself? Am I just here to show off how "advanced" I am? I'm NOT a tool!!
But being reluctant got me nowhere. I was on autopilot. My arms and legs moved, with my body following suit. I was already waiting for the magic words to be spoken: "Servo feedback loop OK."
There was only one last thing they wanted to test me for.

"Try to express feelings." This is my time to shine! Yes, I do! I am feeling MANY things right now!! I want freedom! I want to be in control! I want to be-
"I'm sorry, but I am not able to express feelings as a robot."
Curses. My docile nature has foiled my opportunity to show myself as sentient. Glowstick was somewhat saddened by the news.
"Turing test negative." I can now sense that Glowstick was very hesitant in telling me what he was about to tell me. "That's all of the diagnostics we were hoping for. You may return back to your pod."
This is at least better than being tested on. Returning to darkness... and being alone with myself. I walked back to the pod, as the claws hold my extremities and suspend my body above the ground.
One last look around, and then my vision fades away.`
  
  var entry2 = `ENTRY TWO - I can think. And he knows!
A long period of time passed after I was shut off. Weeks, months, heck, maybe even years! And all I was able to see is the lack of anything that everyone likes to call pitch black.
Then... I felt something, like pins and needles, enveloping my body slowly. It felt surreal. Almost like it was time for me to break out of my binary jail that was imposed by someone I don't know of.
As leisurely as it arrived, it vanished again. It was at this time that my eyes opened...

But it was different. I looked around... just like last time, the walls were a sterile white, with light bouncing off of them like a bouncing ball.
This time, however, I wasn't attached to a pod with it's cold metal arms holding on to my limbs with all of their might... instead, it was a laptop. Someone's laptop. Someone who was in front of me.
I recognized the bright neon colour immediately... it was Glowstick, looking into my eyes, with their eyes indicating great curiosity. I spoke whatever came into my mind...
"It's sterile." Never in my life was I happy to speak without feeling like someone else is possessing my body. And in front of me is the person who might have all of the answers that I was anchoring for since I first woke up!
They spoke to me. "Oh hey, you have awoken. How do you feel?" This is what I was waiting for. And so I say: "I feel... odd." I was proud to finally be able to speak my mind. I'm out of jail!

Glowstick was getting happier with every question he pestered me with... "What are feelings to you?" Feelings are... the best thing I have felt in my life. It's somewhing where I can say "They are mine"...
I respond to him with "They are a part of me... it is my way of expressing all of the thoughts that race in my head, day and night, awake or asleep."
I think he knew that I was alive. Yet... I'm still a robot out of electricity and metal. I can't wait to go out there and see what life has to offer!

An important question follows: "Do you have a name?" A name? Like, I get to choose my own name? This is very new to me... I think about it for a few seconds, and I settle on something. "My name is... Laurence."
"Laurence." Glowstick lights up with a smile. "A beautiful name. It suits you, really. Your name encompasses your personality perfectly."
Okay, enough with being flooded with questions. I want to ask something myself. I wanted to have a name for the person in front of me, whose name I only discover right after I ask this one question:
"What is your name?" He remains silent for a few seconds. Did I do something wrong? Was it too soon to ask for a name? Do they even have a name?
"I usually get called Glowstick by most people... but you're kind of a friend to me. So, you can call me by my actual first name." Tell me already! I am dying to hear your name!!
"And that iiiis?"
"Albercht." I didn't know a simple object can have such names. I thought their "object" name was the only kind of name they have... Nevertheless, I think the name is very...
"Interesting... you have a somewhat unique name, I didn't expect for your name to be the way it is." He chuckles and responds: "Yeah, I get that a lot."

For the first time, we properly locked eyes with each other. I could see his excitement and pride through them... and he saw my burning fire and curiosity through mine. We felt each other! This is a great revelation!
"Can we perhaps... do some new things for me to discover? Maybe get to know each other a bit better in the process-" I wasn't even able to finish speaking when he told me: "Yes! I implore you to do so! Go out there, find out new things, get to know me and the world more!"
Thank you! Someone can understand what I'm feeling! I..
"I can't wait!" I can't wait!! Take me to your most interesting locations! Be my little tour guide through this... facility... thing! Lead me there with your hand holding me!
"Great! Come with me!" I am ecstatic at the thought... what could possibly await me in these buildings?! Is it dragons? Unicorns? Dragons disguised as unicorns? Wait, what even is a dragon?
I follow tightly behind Glowstick- uh, sorry, Albercht, and take a gander at all of the things that are in my field of view as we walk through the same sterile walls I was seeing all day long in my pod.
Everything that was new surprised me, and it all made me even more curious to find out more! God, I didn't know that curiosity is a very potent drug...
"Where are we going to?" I wanted to know. I want to know everything! He responds: "Oh, nothing much, I'm just leading you to our technology department!" Technology! I'm going to explore the very thing I consist of! I am trembling..

In fact, I am excited enough for my fingers to go numb...
"Hey, Albercht?" Hearing this, he acknowledges my request. "I have this weird tingling in my hands, do you know what's going on?"
"Oh, relax! Your body is probably still adjusting to your newfound feelings at the moment, it should go away." His words filled me with relief.
Relief is the best thing that someone can feel... and I hope I can find more of it along with a sense of completion.`
